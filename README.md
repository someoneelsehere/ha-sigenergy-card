Based on the amazing work by [fbradyirl](https://gist.github.com/fbradyirl/08fef90bd11d7bdddf588a56e668d879) and others [here](https://github.com/TypQxQ/Sigenergy-Local-Modbus/discussions/184), this card mirrors the functionality (with numerous changes/fixes) but removes the house (that looks nothing like mine!).

## 1. Uses the [Sigenergy Local Modbus integration](https://github.com/TypQxQ/Sigenergy-Local-Modbus) default entities  
Plus two (that I remember) extras enabled:
- Sigen Plant > Controls > Remote EMS Control Mode
- Sigen Plant > Diagnostic > Rated Energy Capacity

## 2. Create Battery Usable Capacity template helper:
  
*Name*: Sigen Plant Battery Usable Capacity    (for entity_id sensor.sigen_plant_battery_usable_capacity)  
*State*:
```yaml
{{ (states('sensor.sigen_plant_battery_state_of_charge')|float(0) / 100 * states('sensor.sigen_plant_rated_energy_capacity')|float(0))|round(2) }}
```  
*Unit*: kWh  
*Device Class*: Energy  
*State Class*: Total  
*Device*: (optional) Sigen Plant  

## 3. Solar (PV) forecst 
I use [Solcast](https://github.com/BJReplay/ha-solcast-solar) - you'll likely need to modify the entity_id to your solar forecast entity.

## 4. Images  
Save/copy the images into your Home Assistant /config/www/  

- I've created the gateway image, but the  battery one is a vector converstion that needs to be re-created.

## 5. In the UI, add a new *manual* card and paste the yaml from *ha-sigenergy-card.yaml*

Please let me know if something isn't working.
